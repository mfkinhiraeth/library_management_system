## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
- Ikhwah Library Management System -


## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
- The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the day-to-day operations of a library using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It allows users to easily search for books, borrow and return them, while enabling administrators and librarians to manage inventory, track borrow history, and issue notifications for overdue items. Built with Laravel, the system ensures a structured and efficient backend while providing a clean and user-friendly interface. This application aims to replace traditional manual processes, reduce errors, and enhance the overall library experience for both staff and users.
