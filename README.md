## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
- Ikhwah Library Management System -


## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
- The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the day-to-day operations of a library using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It allows users to easily search for books, borrow and return them. Users also can make book reservation in case the book is not available at the time being. Our system also offers membership package where we have various benefits such as fine deduction if the user buy it. User also will not be missed any kind of overdue dates or any upcoming events due to notification system in our website. Built with Laravel, the system ensures a structured and efficient backend while providing a clean and user-friendly interface. This application aims to replace traditional manual processes, reduce errors, and enhance the overall library experience for both staff and users.


## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
1. To design and implement a functional library management system using the MVC framework.
3. To digitize book borrowing and retutning system.
4. To enhance user experience with a reservation function.
